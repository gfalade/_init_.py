Geoff update on GIF research 11/11

So upon doing research into how to run animation I found this in PyGame.org

http://www.pygame.org/project-Pyganim+sprite+animation+module-2106-.html

I've been messing with source code from that zip and studying it 
and it seems pretty straight forward. What we need however is graphics to be able to do so. 
I've been hunting around for some reasonable examples and haven't come up with anything 
worthwhile. Also, the gif's do have to be iterated through as Joe suggested in the meeting.

Not sure if we have any talented graphic artists on our team, but I assure you I am not one 
of them. If we don't, maybe we can lure some student from some graphics program within the 
5 colleges to make up some art for us. Again, if we have someone already that's not necessary. 
With that being said, my cousin's wife is actually a super talented graphics illustrator and 
is trying to break out in graphic design and perhaps she'd be interested in participating just 
to put something on her resume and in her portfolio, so if we really really can't find anyone 
(which is doubtful) that may be an option too.

I know that's kind of getting a head of where we are, but just figured I'd throw out ideas 
if we don't already have that sort of talent on our existing team.
